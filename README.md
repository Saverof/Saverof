======================================================================================================================================

I am C/C++ Programmer
---------------------

I have been programming for more than 7 years, I started with C/C++ and am still studying it to this day. During my studies at the university, I also tried Java, C#, and Assembly. During the study period I developed: 1. A program that analyzes network traffic. 2. A program that allows you to display the Cornu spiral with various parameters, here I became acquainted with graphical interfaces. 3. During pre-graduation practice, I created an application for user authentication using a photo of the palm of the hand. 4. As a thesis, I created an application that determines the license plate number and make of a car from a photo. Subsequently, I got a job at AO "LEPSE" as a software engineer in the CAD bureau (computer-aided production system) in which I work to this day, during the period of work I created a system for processing the storage of signatures, and immediately gained practice in working with the Microsoft SQL Server DBMS and the system Git, I’m currently writing a handler that allows me to create PDF files with the necessary data, client-server data transfer, and I also trained a student and helped users. I love programming and working on interesting problems. As a hobby, I am interested in video games, board games, mastering the Unreal Engine, and also studying literature and articles to improve my professional skills in the C/C++ language. Completed advanced training courses in working with data, “Data Modeling: Practical Immersion in Data.”
